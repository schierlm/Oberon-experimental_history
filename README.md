# The Experimental Oberon operating system and the Revised Oberon-2 programming language

This is an archive of older versions from [Experimental Oberon](https://github.com/andreaspirklbauer/Oberon-experimental).

Some versions were downloaded from [Software Heritage](https://softwareheritage.org/), some are from my private archives when I build Experimental Oberon disk images.

The movie files as well as the disk images have been removed, and are instead available as an archive (containing all the different movie files/disk images)
in the Releases section.

Note that the disk image archive is a `7-Zip` archive containing uncompressed `tar` archives, as that way saves a lot of space (all the original .gz archives
have a few hundred Megabytes, uncompressed more than 9 Gigabytes, yet the recompressed archive is less than 8 Megabytes.)
